<!-- 1#
A structure of a html page is similar to a upside down tree. We are values to our branches head and body and so to our tree -->
<!-- 	html (root)
			/	\
  		head	body (branches)
 -->
<!-- <html>
	<head></head> head is where we put any metadata and style of our website
	<body></body> content of our website
</html> -->
<!-- When we're writing html, we are just adding branches to these two branches.
 -->
<!-- 2# We add elements or tags to our branches head and body.
	They can be applied in three ways: -->

<!-- <element> #Self closed
<element>value</element> #bind with a value
<element attribute="value">value</element>  -->

<!-- elements can have multiple attributes and multiple attributes can have multiple values.
 -->
 <!-- 3# -->
<!DOCTYPE html> <!--#this element tells the browser that we are using html 5; If you omit this option, the browser will decide upon which version to use.
 -->
<html>
	<head>
<!-- 		attribute  value
				||		||-->
		<meta charset="UTF-8">

		<!-- #assign the title to the tab -->
		<title>hello, world!</title>

		<!-- #How to handle the website in mobile devices! -->
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> <!-- #this is a tag -->

<!-- css is a combination of a selector, a property, and a value as follows: -->
<!--we selected the p from paragraph element, property color and value as green;-->
		<style>

p { color: green; }

		</style>

	</head>
	<body>
		<p>hello,world!</p> <!-- <p> paragraph </p> -->
	</body>
</html>
